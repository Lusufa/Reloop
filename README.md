Reloop: India's Hyper-Local Upcycling Ecosystem
Reloop is a web application designed to foster a circular economy by connecting individuals with local artisans to transform discarded materials into valuable, unique products.

About The Project
Every day, countless items with remaining potential are sent to landfills. At the same time, talented local artisans and makers struggle to source affordable materials. Reloop was built to bridge this gap, creating a community-driven marketplace that turns waste into opportunity and champions sustainable living.

How It Works
Reloop operates on three simple roles:

Givers: Users who list their discardable materials, giving them a second chance.

Makers: Artisans and craftspeople who find and use these materials to create new products.

Buyers: Consumers looking for unique, sustainable goods with a story.

Features
Hyper-Local Focus: Connects users within a 5-10km radius to reduce carbon footprint.

Economic Empowerment: Provides a platform for local artisans to showcase their skills and sell their products.

Environmental Impact: Directly diverts waste from landfills and promotes conscious consumption.

Community Building: Fosters a strong, local community centered around sustainability and creativity.
